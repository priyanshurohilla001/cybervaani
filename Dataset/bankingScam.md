# Banking Scams

## Overview
Banking scams involve fraudsters impersonating bank representatives, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) officials, or financial institutions to deceive victims into sharing sensitive information or making fraudulent payments. These scams exploit customers’ fears related to security, KYC verification, and fraudulent transactions.
